# Liminality 

Developed by Sniper1_1. Feel free to use, but please give credit.

Datapack contains several liminal spaces-inspired dimensions. A few have unique ways of entering/exiting, all can be entered via portals that spawn in each dimension. These portal cycle every minute to randomly link to another dimension. Will you get lucky and find one at the right time to get out?
